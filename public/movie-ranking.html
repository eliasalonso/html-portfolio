<h1>The Best Movies According to Elias</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Interstellar</h3>

<p>
  It's my favorite because of all the memories that i have with different
  people, and it's really good in general.
</p>

<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>

<p>This is the greatest military-action movie of all time, no discussion.</p>

<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>

<p>
  This movie is beatiful, really packed with emotions and important events in
  the mind of a chil-like adult.
